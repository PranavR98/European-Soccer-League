# European-Soccer-League

The idea of this model is to start a new soccer tournament in Europe which has the
best of soccer. To design a seamless model, it is first important to understand the
different kind of metrics which shall be required to kick things off. It is important to
understand how various teams generally fare in such competitions, how players are
performing over the years, discovering the team chemistry which would help us
determine how different permutations and combinations of players from different
nationalities may play together as a team as well as how they fare against other teams.
With this, we should be able to ultimately determine what kind of players have the
likelihood of standing out among other players. Keeping various such metrics in mind,
we can come up with a model which can produce a tournament which will pair teams
where the level of competition is higher.
